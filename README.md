# Hybrid-math-word-problem-solver
Math  Word  Problems  (MWPs)  are  mathematical  problems  in  which
significant information is presented in natural language rather than in
mathematical  notations.   Word  problems  often  narrative  of  some  sort,
they  are  also  referred  to  as  story  problems.   The  proposed  system  is
built as a combination of a verb classification model, an encoder-decoder
model,  and a regular expression model that takes math word problem
as  input  and  generates  the  corresponding  math  expression  as  output.
The system also has the ability to categorize whether the given input is
an interrogative math word problem or not, it helps to avoid unneces-
sary non-word problems to the system.  Verb classification model used
here is trying to solve some kind of word problems which are in proper
syntactic  format  based  on  the  verb  category  and  the  encoder-decoder
model  can  solve  all  kind  of  word  problems  with  the  help  of  recurrent
neural network.  A regular expression model also takes part in the model
to identify and solve outlier mathematical expression
